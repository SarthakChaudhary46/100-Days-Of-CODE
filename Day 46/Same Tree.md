# 100.Same Tree

Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

- Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
- Output: true

*Example 2:*

- Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
- Output: false

*Example 3:*
<img width="440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/SarthakChaudhary46/100-Days-Of-CODE/assets/86872379/f53bf620-b453-4cf3-84ee-416fcac10cc2">

- Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
- Output: false
 
*Constraints:*

- The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
- -104 <= Node.val <= 104
