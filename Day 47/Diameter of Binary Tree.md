# 543.Diameter of Binary Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

 

*Example 1:*

- Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
- Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

*Example 2:*

- Input: root = [1,2]
- Output: 1
 
*Constraints:*

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100
