# 404.Sum of Left Leaves

Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of all left leaves.

A leaf is a node with no children. A left leaf is a leaf that is the left child of another node.

- Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
- Output: 24\
Explanation: There are two left leaves in the binary tree, with values 9 and 15 respectively.

*Example 2:*

- Input: root = [1]
- Output: 0
 

*Constraints:*

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
- -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000**
